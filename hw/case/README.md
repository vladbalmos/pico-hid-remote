There's two versions for the enclosure, the original designed around a 18650 battery and a protoboard and an updated version designed for a proper PCB and a battery taken from an old BlackBerry Q10 phone.

Both versions have their issues. The V1's overall size is a little to small for the amount of wires inside and the thin walls make it flex and doesn't seal properly. Also the buttons had to be superglued to stay in place.

The V2 is a really tight fit because again I didn't account for the size of the jumper wires. Also some filing is required on the lid interior because I forgot to cut out some interior features of the model.
